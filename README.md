# vME™ ("virtual me")

## We Have Liftoff!
### Three reasons I’m launching my vME™ and you should too.

### 1. Digital Silos Impede Innovation
Nowadays, almost all of us are using digital silos that put us at the mercy of others, who control how we create, store, process, view and share data. These silos affect all aspects of our lives: banking, shopping, medical, publishing, social, education, entertainment, etc. This partitioning of data leads to user experience inefficiencies, manifesting as tedious tasks that should be quick and easy. For example, finding a note when we don’t know what device or service was used to record it requires searching each device manually until it is found.

While it might be useful just to integrate these disparate silos to form new composite systems, this is often difficult or impossible because the silos are not sufficiently exposed to allow such integration. For example, we could create an autoresponder for our instant messenger, email, SMS and voicemail services that switches automatically based on GPS locations, but we might find that SMS routing cannot be altered on our phone network. Our inability to innovate, in this case, stems from non-ownership of the data and any platform code that processes it.

A vME (“virtual me”) transfers data ownership from service providers to the users themselves. This gives users the freedom to innovate as they see fit, opening up endless possibilities to improve their experience of these services. Guided by my personal motto, “Happiness is… Improving,” I’ve started building my own vME with the hopes to someday have full control over my digital presence.

### 2. There’s No Free Lunch
Many digital services are run on cloud platforms such as AWS. These services could offer direct access to their users, but few companies want to lay open their internal architectures to users. It’s not hard to see why.

Some have a major dichotomy on their hands. For example, social networks may have users that want to share funny videos containing a business message, but allowing this would directly conflict with the network’s revenue model of selling paid advertisement views. This leads to networks suppressing otherwise wildly-popular, or “viral,” content in an effort to push creators of such quasi-commercial content into purchasing advertising instead.

It doesn’t end there, of course. Businesses pass on the cost of these paid ad views to the users who buy their products, effectively subsidizing these “free” social networks through price inflation. Ad-centric revenue models are particularly punitive to small businesses, who may be forced to court “deep pocket” investors, typically from very weak negotiating positions, merely to acquire funds to pay for sufficient public exposure to reach “critical mass.” Investors in these small Internet start-ups typically receive large equity stakes for doing little more than enriching social network operators.

vME removes the illusory promise of a free lunch, allowing data to flow directly between users by letting them pay for exactly those resources they wish to consume.

### 3. Average is Not Best
Designing a system that will be used by billions of people can give rise to support nightmares if the user interface is confusing to some, or most, of the target audience. Advanced features may be suppressed, or even removed, simply to make the customer support problem manageable. This “good enough for most people” design philosophy almost necessarily precludes producing a system that can be made optimal for anyone.

This problem really rears its ugly head when trying to automate tasks without source code access, or even just the ability to override hotkey bindings. There is no “feature” more advanced than program code modification, after all. Those people with the skill to adapt a service to unforeseen or special circumstances find themselves unable to do so because the service silo presents a “sealed box,” designed against least-common-denominator use cases.

vME’s can be adopted as pre-packaged systems, or they can be built-to-spec, either by individuals or by service contractors in an open marketplace. This allows vME’s to provide experiences specifically tailored to each user’s individual lifestyle.

And there you have it—three reasons I’m launching my vME and you should, too.

If you want to start taking ownership of your data and code connect with me and I’ll help you launch your very own vME.
